## Lecture 2: Introduction to Statistics

### Key Points:
1. **Statistical Modeling:**
   - Statistical models simplify complex data, helping to uncover patterns and make predictions.
   - Models like Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions are used to describe real-world data (e.g., number of siblings).

2. **Assumptions for Analysis:**
   - A big assumption is that data points are **independent and identically distributed (IID)**, which allows for easier analysis.

3. **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Models:**
   - **Parametric Models:** Have a set number of parameters (e.g., Poisson distribution estimating \( \lambda \)).
   - **Non-Parametric Models:** Donâ€™t assume a specific distribution and require more flexibility.

4. **Bias and Variance:**
   - **Bias:** Systematic error between the estimator and true value.
   - **Variance:** How much the estimates fluctuate.
   - The goal is to balance the two when selecting models.
